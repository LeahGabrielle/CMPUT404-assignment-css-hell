				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>I am a computing science student at the University of Alberta.
					My expected graduation date is December 2016.
					I make video games sometimes. And I do math other times.
					What I like about computing science is how there are limitless possibilities.
					I can create most anything I think up.</p>

				<h1> Experience </h1>
				<p> I've worked as a summer student with the Strathcona County Library Bookmobile,
					a camp leader with Red Deer College, and a sales associate at Bed Bath and Beyond.
					Most of my work experience has been in customer service or working with children.
					I want to further my knowledge in computer science by working in the game industry. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="offer">
				<h1>Skills</h1>
				<p> In school, I've learned programming languages such as Python, C, C++, and Java.
					I've taken classes on algorithms, games, databases, and software engineering.
					I've also enjoyed working on in teams, since many of my classes had large group projects.
					I think it's a great way to problem solve and it encourages the flow of ideas. </p>
